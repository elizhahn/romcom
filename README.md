## Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well ... maybe that's true. We're going to make an app that generates romance novel covers!





# Make Your Own Cover
To create their own cover, the user can select the "Make Your Own Cover" button and enter values in each input field. To see thier new cover, the user can then click "Make My Book". This button should take the user to the main view and display their new cover.
